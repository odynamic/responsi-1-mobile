    <string name="club_history_text">
    Olympique de Marseille was founded in 1899 by Rene Dufaure de Montmirail in the vibrant city of Marseille, France.
    The club was created with the vision of uniting the people of the port city through sport.
    From the very beginning, Marseille developed a strong footballing identity, built on passion, pride, and a fearless attacking style that reflected the character of its supporters.
    In its early decades, OM became a powerhouse in southern France and soon gained national recognition by winning several league and cup titles.

    \n\nDuring the post-war years, Olympique de Marseille continued to grow in popularity and influence.
    The club became a symbol of the city, representing the diversity, energy, and resilience of Marseille people.
    The 1970s and 1980s marked periods of both success and challenge, as OM experienced fluctuations in performance but never lost the unwavering devotion of its fans.
    The atmosphere at the Stade Velodrome remained one of the most passionate and intimidating in European football.

    \n\nThe club reached its golden era in the late 1980s and early 1990s under the leadership of Bernard Tapie.
    With world-class players such as Jean-Pierre Papin, Abedi Pele, and Didier Deschamps, Marseille dominated French football and achieved the greatest moment in its history in 1993.
    That year, OM defeated AC Milan 1-0 in Munich to win the UEFA Champions League, becoming the first and only French club to lift the trophy, a milestone that still defines the pride of the city.

    \n\nToday, Olympique de Marseille remains one of the most iconic and respected football clubs in Europe.
    The team continues to compete at the highest level in Ligue 1, driven by its loyal supporters and rich tradition.
    The fierce rivalry with Paris Saint-Germain, known as Le Classique, embodies more than just football—it reflects the enduring contrast between the north and south of France.
    Through triumphs and challenges, OM stands as a living symbol of determination, unity, and the unbreakable spirit of Marseille.
